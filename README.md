# PRN method
### It's my first paper! I love it so much!!!
## Parallel relation network(PRN) for fault detection of train transmission systems in zero-fault sample   
Proposed such a method for Beijing PHM 2024 conference  
With my paper and all codes!  
## Dataset  
Datasets are not included cause it's too large  
You can download it by https://www.icphm.org  
### Actually those code sucks(not so clean), but they're truly useful
