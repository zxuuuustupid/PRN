# PRN method
## It's my first paper! I love it so much!!!
parallel relation network(PRN) for fault detection of train transmission systems in zero-fault sample   
proposed such a method for Beijing PHM 2024 conference  
with my paper and all codes!  
datasets are not included cause it's too large  
you can download it by https://www.icphm.org/?page_id=9110  
Actually those code sucks, but they're truly useful
