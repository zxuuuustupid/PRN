# PRN method
### "It's my first paper! I love it so much!"   
Let me give a simple introduction to the artical. With all my codes.   
Here's the `pdf` of the artical: [PRN-20240829.pdf](PRN-20240829.pdf)   
## Parallel relation network for fault detection of train transmission systems with zero-fault sample  
In this artical, we proposed such a method for Beijing PHM 2024 conference   
## Model structure

## Auxiliary Sample Library (ASL)  
An ASL is constructed to help extract high level features. Samples in this lib are generated by the soft Brownian offset method.  To know more about this method, you can read this artical: **[Out-of-distribution Detection and Generation using Soft Brownian Offset Sampling and Autoencoders](2105.02965)**
## Dataset  
Datasets are not included cause it's too large  
You can download it on conference website: https://www.icphm.org

### Actually those code sucks(not so clean), but they're truly useful
