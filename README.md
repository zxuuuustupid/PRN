# PRN method
### It's my first paper! I love it so much!!!
## Parallel relation network(PRN) for fault detection of train transmission systems in zero-fault sample  
Proposed such a method for Beijing PHM 2024 conference  
With my paper and all codes!  

## Dataset  
Datasets are not included cause it's too large  
You can download it on conference website: https://www.icphm.org
